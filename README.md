#  WhatEven!

# An app designed to combat fast-fashion and avoid the "What I got vs. what I ordered"

A new user must create a new account and create a unique username and password. 
Existing users can login directly.
The homepage consists of previous posts made by the user and other users. 
A user has the option to delete their own post, not others.
Each post has a comment section where other users can comment on the product if they also have seen/bought it.
Each user can choose to delete their own comments, and keep adding to any post including their own.
A user can comment and the comment will be shown directly in the TableView, same concept with posting a post to the CollectionView.

To start off there are 5 dummy users that I create with each one having a post, and 2 comments each. 
This was to test the functionality. 



To add later to improve user experience:
The UI.  It is a mess I know.
In the future, a user will be able to comment a picture and compare an item they also receieved.

There would also be some sort of AI implementation where if there is the same item posted then there would be a way to compare the post to another post of the same item and warn the user that it already exists.  

There will be a score system where the highest score would signify the most ridiculous result, and then
the lowest will sigify the least horrible item.  
Top scored posts would be featured on most recent feed at all times. (since it is popular)
