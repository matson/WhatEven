# An app designed to combat fast-fashion and avoid the "What I got vs. what I ordered"

Background: 

This app was created to combat fast fashion and scams found all other instagram and other popular social media
outlets that target consumerism. 
Users will be able to post picture of their clothing, and if they wish may also post items other than clothing. 

I added a couple of posts and comments to test the functionalty.  You will see these upon logging in and seeing
the dashboard. 

To add later to improve user experience:
-The UI. I will add more features
-User will be able to edit posts and comments. 

There would also be some sort of AI implementation where if there is the same item posted then there would be a way to compare the post to another post of the same item and warn the user that it already exists.  

-There will be a score system where the highest score would signify the most ridiculous item/scam, and then
the lowest will sigify the least horrible item.  
-Top scored posts would be featured on most recent feed at all times. (since it is popular)


Instructions: 

-Make sure you are running Version 15.3 of Xcode, and the app includes the Firebase SDK
-Run the application and register.  The new user info will get stored to Firebase. 
-Once you register, navigate to the portal and login with those user credentials. 
-You will be taken to the homepage where you will be able to create posts, comments, and delete your own posts and comments. 
-Deployment target should be 16.0 or higher.
